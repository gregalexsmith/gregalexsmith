_Working theory - We can use 5 categories to look at how software creates value. This is a reflection of my experienced and interests so far (software, hardware & the web) and am curious to see how far these apply, and where they might fall short._

## Productivity

Software increases automation, distribution, parallelization, systematization, network effects and more, which all increase the productivity of making or maintaining things.

_It‚Äôs easier to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ with software._

## Certainty

We want to understand our current world and how we got here. Software assists this though systematization, recording, logging, data aggregation and storage.

_We can understand what's happened and what we have now._

## Ambiguity

Making decisions about the future is difficult. Software helps us simulate and map out possible paths, risks and tradeoffs

_We can make informed decisions about the future_

## Access

Shared understanding, opportunity, and optionality can all be positively impacted by software with increased distribution (mostly the internet).

_It‚Äôs easier to learn, use, contribute and distribute with software_

## Connection

Related to access, software enables us to connect by making collaboration, community, and relationships more available.

_We can work together and connect with others_

## So What?

I‚Äôm hoping this will help to better understand what ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù software can be. Both looking back on how things work today and identifying future opportunities.

### Example üéπ

_As an example, let‚Äôs brainstorm a bit on the process of building a musical instrument (synthesizer)._

**Productivity**

- Circuit, PCB, CAD and other design software make creating the product much easier. We can think of these as providing tools, automation, libraries, templates, etc to the process
- Software accelerates manufacturing and translates designs between different systems to get the product built
- More things like parts supply, distribution, commerce have all been made easier with the use of software

**Certainty**

- Does the circuit work as intended? Software makes it easier to measure, compare options, validate and log results to answer this question.
- What‚Äôs the state of things? - Parts in stock, parts/products shipped, payments

**Ambiguity**

- We can simulate options with software
  - What circuit design will meet the product requirements?
  - If we change these values, what might happen?
  - What should it look like?
  - How should the components be arranged and connected on the circuit board?
- We can understand risks and tradeoffs
  - How long are the parts likely to work under certain conditions?

**Access**

- Learning & Education - The internet provides easy, instant access to the right information we need to design and build the product
- Information & Resources - We can use shared + trusted component libraries in our designs
- Distribution - We can share a virtual version of our synth or open source the hardware designs to the world immediately

**Connection**

- Customers/Audience - we can find people across the world who are interested in the products
- Collaborate - We can work with others to develop and deliver the product, independent of time and location
- Connect - Contribute to online communities, gather interest and develop connections around our synthesizer product
