_A snapshot of my current understanding and some sense of priority for the process of building things (like products, websites, apps, code, hardware, understanding/knowledge, etc)_

### People first

Prioritize the experience of both the people using it and building it with you.

### Simplify

Make it easy to use and understand.

_Prioritize UX, create good summaries & abstractions, write less code_

### Organize

Make it easy to explore and understand.

_Good structure, group logic & functionality together, follow common patterns, etc_

### Add value

It should make life better (big or small) for someone and allow them to:

_Do what they’re best at, be creative, get things done, learn something new, play, explore, make a decision, develop connections, find a flow state, help others, use their intuition, build more things, etc_

### Automate (the boring stuff)

Reduce complexity and leave room for the fun stuff.

_Tooling, formatting, spell checking, automation, templates, etc_

### Compound

Create things that can be built on, and contribute back to things that you use to build.

### Longevity

Choose technologies or platforms that will likely last as long as possible and are less dependant on single points of failure (like a closed platform)

### Safe

Safe to: use, update, change, release, forget about

### Pick a foundation

Choosing a standard (that’s been around for awhile and not shrinking) means more builders, community, common knowledge and some peace of mind about the future.

_Code language, file format, communication standards_
