_Working theory_ - Teams who **decide what they’re going to build collaboratively** are able to deliver value with increased velocity and quality over time. Even with the correct domain expertise, a non-collaborative environment can lead to several classic pitfalls.

## The Team

_This post will use an example of a cross-functional team at a SAAS company with some level of autonomy and a set of goals that are inline with the company’s strategy. The teams core domains are product, design and engineering._

Each domain on the team brings it’s own optimized expertise to the table:

- **Product** — business strategy, customer knowledge, growth models, etc
- **Design** — customer experience, branding & design consistency, UX, accessibility
- **Engineering** — technical complexity (delivery time), maintenance, tech costs (infra), system design

## Collaboration

If all are present when deciding what to build - trade-offs are surfaced, constraints are established and a deliverable solution is formed. There’s more opportunity to ask:

- Is there another way to accomplish this that would be faster to build or easier to use?
- What if we delivered a smaller, simpler solution first?
- Can we make this a better experience?
- Will this project will drive customer and/or business outcomes?

With balanced collaboration, there’s also a reinforcing feedback loop. The team can build on it’s shared understanding and better navigate future unknowns as they encounter them.

## Non-Collaboration

Here’s a few ways to think about non-collaboration, and what it might look like on this team.

Taking each domain’s approach to an extreme might look like:

- **Product first** - A solution that provides immense value - possibly difficult to use, technically complex or unsustainable.
- **Design first** - A solution that provides an amazing experience — possibly low value and technically complex
- **Engineering first** - A solution that is low complexity or technically interesting — possibly low value and difficult to use

If there are only 2 of the 3 domains present, there’s a higher chance of questions like:

- **Product + Design** - Why does it take so long to build? Why do refinement meetings take so long?
- **Design + Engineering** - Why are we building this? Why isn’t this profitable?
- **Engineering + Product** - Why aren't people using it as we thought? Why are there so many help desk requests?

## Notes

Deciding what to build certainly depends on the overall culture as well. Do the company ship incrementally, to beta customers, or in a large features announcements? How does the team engage with customers and obtain feedback? What are the limits and constraints for the company - business, market, technology, etc?

Balanced collaboration remains a net-positive given any situation above. These are just more to consider and weight into the decision of “what should we build next”?
