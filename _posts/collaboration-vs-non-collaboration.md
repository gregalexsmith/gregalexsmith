_Working theory_ - Teams who **decide what to build collaboratively** are able to deliver value with increased velocity and quality over time. Even with the correct domain expertise, a non-collaborative environment can lead to poor outcomes.

## The Team

_We'll use an example of a cross-functional team at a SAAS company with some level of autonomy and goals that align with the company’s strategy. The teams core domains are product, design and engineering._

Each domain brings their own optimized expertise to the table:

- **Product** — business strategy, customer knowledge, growth models, etc
- **Design** — branding & design consistency, customer experience, UX, accessibility
- **Engineering** — technical complexity (delivery time), maintenance, tech costs (infra), system design

## Collaboration

If all domains are present when deciding what to build; trade-offs are surfaced, constraints are established and a deliverable solution is formed. There’s more opportunity to ask:

- Can we make this a better experience?
- Will this project will drive customer and/or business outcomes?
- Are there compounding effects we should consider?
- Can we solve this in a way that would be faster to deliver or easier to use?
- What if we delivered a smaller, simpler solution first?

Balanced collaboration also builds a reinforcing feedback loop. As the team navigates the project and future unknowns, they have a shared map with all the context and trade-offs that can be continuously updated.

## Non-Collaboration

_Here are a few ways to think about non-collaboration, and what it might look like on this team._

If each domain’s approach is taken to an extreme, it might look like:

- **Product first** - A high value solution or large collection of features - possibly difficult to use, technically complex or unsustainable.
- **Design first** - A beautifully designed or seamless experience — possibly low value or technically complex
- **Engineering first** - A technically interesting or low complexity solution — possibly low value or difficult to use

If 2 of the 3 domains are present, there’s a higher chance of questions like:

- **Product + Design** - Why does it take so long to build? Why do refinement meetings take so long?
- **Design + Engineering** - Why are we building this? Why isn’t this profitable?
- **Engineering + Product** - Why aren't people using it as we thought? Why are there so many help desk requests?

## Notes

Deciding what to build depends on the overall culture as well. Does the company ship incrementally, to beta customers, or all at once in a large announcement? How does the team engage with customers and obtain feedback? What are the limits and constraints for the company - business, market, technology, etc?

In any case, balanced collaboration remains a net-positive. A team that has a shared understanding of the context and trade-offs is much better equipped to keep momentum and answer the question "what should we build next?"
